# Rules of Engagement

An open source web app designed to make the current ITS Season Tournament rules for Corvus Beli's wargame Infinity.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## PDF converter script

The bulk of the mission data used by this app is generated by [corvus_pdf_converter](https://github.com/JosephMassie/corvus_pdf_converter). This python script will generate the foundational data for each mission directly from the PDFs put out by Corvus Beli the makers of Infinity. This data isn't complete, primarily the deployment maps and some unit profiles. The deployment maps can't be extracted well so these are created here on a tool used to make them by hand in CSS to be best displayed on mobile. For the unit profiles, tables, and other various data errors will need to be corrected by hand.
